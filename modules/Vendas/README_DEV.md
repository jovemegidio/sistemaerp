Development Docker Compose

This repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` to run a local development stack with MySQL, Redis, the app, and the background worker.

Quick start (PowerShell):

1. Copy example env:

```powershell
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env to set strong values for JWT_SECRET and DB_ROOT_PASSWORD if desired
```

2. Start the stack:

```powershell
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Wait for services to start (check logs):

```powershell
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f --tail=50 app
```

4. Run DB migrations (once the DB is healthy):

```powershell
# run migrations from host (uses your local node/npm)
npm run migrate
```

5. Check app and worker logs:

```powershell
docker-compose logs -f --tail=100 app
docker-compose logs -f --tail=100 worker
```

Notes:
- `docker-compose.yml` mounts the repo into the containers and runs `npm install` inside them on start. That makes iteration easy but may be slower the first run.
- If you prefer not to run `npm install` inside containers, build a Dockerfile for the app and worker and reference it in compose instead.
- The compose file expects a `.env` file in the repo root (copy from `.env.example`).

If you want, I can now bring up the stack and run migrations here; confirm and I'll run the commands.
