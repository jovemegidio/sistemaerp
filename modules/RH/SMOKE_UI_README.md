Puppeteer UI smoke test

Purpose
- Run a headless Puppeteer smoke test that authenticates using the debug token endpoint and captures screenshots of key admin pages.

Quick run (local)

Make sure Node >= 18 is installed and dependencies are installed:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run smoke:ui
```

What it does
- Waits for http://127.0.0.1:3000 to be reachable
- Requests a debug admin token from `/api/debug/generate-token` (non-production only)
- Sets token in localStorage and navigates to `areaadm.html`
- Captures screenshots into `./screenshots`

Notes
- The script uses conservative heuristics and tests the visible "Funcionários" flow by default. If you need Holerite/Ponto coverage, either add selectors or expose those menu items in the frontend.
- Running on CI requires starting the app and MySQL before the job runs; the provided workflow example shows one approach.
