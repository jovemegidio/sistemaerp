Migration procedure (safe)

1) Local / Staging

- Make sure you have a fresh backup of the `funcionarios` table:
  mysqldump -u <user> -p aluforce_vendas funcionarios > funcionarios.backup.sql

- Apply migration (PowerShell script provided):
  .\scripts\apply_migration.ps1

- Run smoke tests:
  npm run smoke:full -- <email_test> <senha_test> <id_test>

2) Production (remote)

Option A (GitHub Actions - recommended):

- Add these repository secrets in GitHub: SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, PROD_HOST, PROD_USER, DB_USER, DB_PASS, TEST_EMAIL, TEST_PASS, TEST_ID, optionally DB_NAME.
- Trigger the workflow from Actions -> Remote Apply Migration -> Run workflow.
- Or trigger remotely from CLI (requires GITHUB_TOKEN with repo permissions):
  export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
  export GITHUB_OWNER=your-user-or-org
  export GITHUB_REPO=your-repo
  ./scripts/trigger_remote_workflow.sh

Option B (manual remote via SSH):

- Edit and export the following env vars on your workstation before running the remote script:
  export PROD_HOST=your.host.example
  export PROD_USER=deploy
  export SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa
  export REMOTE_PROJECT_PATH=/var/www/recursos-humanos
  export DB_USER=root
  export DB_PASS=your_db_password  # optional, better to use .my.cnf on server

- Run the remote apply script:
  bash scripts/apply_migration_remote.sh

Notes
- Always keep the backup files and verify them before removing.
- Do not commit credentials to the repo.
- After applying to production, run smoke tests from a safe network location.
